However, I've made most of the configuration completely optional so that the experience remains as close to vanilla if you choose to do so. Most of the in-application variables are recolored so that your custom snippets can be used easily with the theme.\nThis theme makes heavy use of the \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings\"\u003estyle settings\u003c/a\u003e plugin, which controls most of the features in the theme. The theme is perfectly usable even without style settings, but it's only a fraction of what it actually is with the plugin.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI will respond to feature/code removal only if there is substantial evidence of it being a direct copy of the original code and not just a simple imitation. (Please keep this point in mind before accusing me of being a low-effort theme developer.)\n\n### If you like my theme:\nI've made this theme primarily for my own purposes and it's completely free, but if you do like it enough to consider throwing a few coins in my hat, here's a link.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/anubisnekhet\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png\" alt=\"Buy Me A Coffee\" style=\"height: 60px !important;width: 217px !important;\" \u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\n## License\nAnuPpuccin is licensed under the GPL-3.0 license which allows you to modify the code freely, however the Copyright and license notices must be preserved in your CSS.

If you want to share your customizations, feel free to do so!\n\n## Features\n\n### Custom palette\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"assets/gh-colorscheme-preview.webp\"\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\nThe theme supports various palettes (5 in the base theme and even more if you use the \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/AnubisNekhet/AnuPpuccin/blob/main/snippets/extended-colorschemes.css\"\u003eextended colorschemes\u003c/a\u003e snippet) which include many popular colorschemes such as Catppuccin and Dracula. These are heavily integrated into the theme as they are directly used to stylize various UI elements.\n\n### Layouts\nAnuppuccin currently supports 2 layout variants.\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"assets/gh-layout-preview.webp\"\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\n### Rainbow folders\nThe theme comes with a toggleable rainbow folder snippet which color-codes your folders as per their order in the filesystem.\u003cbr\u003e\nIt's great if you need to easily distinguish between folders or if you want to make your vault look a bit prettier (Both in my case :P)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"assets/gh-rainbow-preview.webp\"\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\n#### Full rainbow theme\nThis snippet makes the rainbow theme apply to the first layer of the root directory, aka only direct children.\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can choose if it applies to root files as well and customise the indentation border color.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n#### Simple rainbow theme\nThis snippet makes the rainbow theme apply to every folder in your filesystem, and the order is determined by the children's place in the parent folder.\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can toggle if the recolor applies to the title, the collapse border, the collapse icon and you can append a small icon to the folder title as well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Alternate tabs\n\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"assets/gh-preview-tabs.webp\"\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\n### Customisable Decorations\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"assets/gh-decorations-preview.webp\"\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\nBold and italic colors can be toggled on and off and can be customised according to the palette as well.\n\n### Custom Backgrounds\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"assets/bg-image-preview.webp\"\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\n### Callouts\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"assets/gh-callout-preview.webp\"\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\nThe theme comes with many custom callout styles (which can be toggled so they won't interfere with your own callout snippet).\u003cbr\u003e\nThe snippet also includes support for using the colors of your selected palette which means that the callouts don't ever look out of place :)\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you use the admonition plugin/have custom callout colors, they won't be affected by the recolor as it only targets vanilla callouts. However, you can make them use AnuPpuccin's palette to support dynamic per-palette theming.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Custom checkboxes \u0026 Speech bubbles\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"assets/gh-checkbox-preview.webp\" width=\"50%\"\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\nAnuppuccin's custom checkboxes try to mimic the original checkbox design as much as possible, while still being optional incase you want to use your own checkbox snippet.\nSpeech bubbles have been provided which are useful for language learners and RPG vault users alike.\u003cbr\u003eCustom checkboxes have been designed to match those provided by the \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/ceciliamay/obsidianmd-theme-primary\"\u003ePrimary\u003c/a\u003e theme for ease of migration and consistency.\n\n| Syntax | Description

color on the top-most bar.\n\n### Simplified markdown embeds\nMarkdown embeds have an alternate styling with an animated variant which can be toggled globally using style settings or individually using alt names for embeds, for example: `![[embed|alt-name]]`\n\n| Embed style | Alt name |\n| ----------- | -------- |\n| Seamless | seamless |\n\n## Colorschemes used\n**Note**: Colorschemes that aren't in the base theme can be used through the [extended colorschemes](https://github.com/AnubisNekhet/AnuPpuccin/blob/main/snippets/extended-colorschemes.css) snippet. \u003cbr\u003e **Important**: Some colorschemes have been been modified to fit the Catppuccin color value style, which means there will be some changes made to make the theme feel more natural.\n\n| Theme | Light Mode | Dark Mode

REST API 방식과 비교하여 알아 보겠습니다.\n\n# REST API vs GraphQL\n\nREST API 는 클라이언트가 서버에게 데이터를 요청할 때마다 서버는 사전에 정의된 Endpoint 에 해당되는 데이터를 응답으로 전송합니다. 서버에서는 클라이언트에게 필요한 데이터의 구조화 형식을 미리 정의해야 하죠. 그렇게 정의된 데이터를 클라이언트는 받게 됩니다. 이렇게 ==메소드와 URI 를 조합해서 예측이 가능한 일정한 정보를 요청할 수 있다는 것이 장점입니다.==\n\n```console\nhttps://application.com/api/v1/coins\nhttps://application.com/api/v1/chains\n```\n\n하지만 급변하는 기획과 개발 환경 속에서 이렇게 미리 정의한 구조는 변경해야할 일이 잦을 수 있고 호환성을 고려하여 API 별로 Version 관리가 필요 할 수 있습니다. 게다가 추가적인 정보를 위해서는 별도의 API 를 호출 해야할 수 있고 클라이언트에서 여러번 요청을 보내는 것은 코드의 비동기 처리를 복잡하게 만들 뿐더러 [N+1 쿼리](https://zetawiki.com/wiki/N%2B1_%EC%BF%BC%EB%A6%AC_%EB%AC%B8%EC%A0%9C) 문제를 발생 시킬 수있습니다.\n\nGraphQL 은 이러한 문제를 극복하기 위해 원하는 정확한 리소스와 원하는 필드를 지정 할 수있습니다.\nREST API 에서는 API 작성자, 즉 서버가 리소스를 정의하여 무엇을 포함 할지 결정했다면 ==GraphQL 은 클라이언트가 무엇을 포함할 지 결정 합니다.== REST 에서 Endpoint 를 여러개 만들어서 호출하는 방식과 다르게 단일 진입점으로 단 하나의 Endpoint 만으로 모든 데이터를 요청 할 수 있습니다.\n\n```graphql\n// GraphQL Schema\nquery GetAllCoins {\n\tcoins {\n\t\tname\n\t\tsymbol\n\t\tchain\n\t\tprice\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n이를 통해 클라이언트는 필요한 데이터만을 취할 수 있고, 네트워크 트래픽이나 대역폭을 절약할 수 있습니다.\nGraphQL 은 Schema 를 사용하여 Schema 에 정의된 관계에 따라 추가 데이터를 가져오는 복잡한 쿼리를 보낼 수 있습니다. ==REST API 에서 추가 데이터를 가져오기 위해 여러번의 API 요청을 했던 것을 하나의 요청으로 효율적으로 처리 할 수 있게 됩니다.==\n\nREST API 나 GraphQL 이나 모두 HTTP 를 사용하여 요청을 하고 JSON 형태로 데이터를 반환 할 수 있습니다. 단지 정의된 값을 자판기처럼 받을 것이냐, 직접 필요한 값을 요청하여 받을 것이냐 가 주요 차이점 입니다.\n\nGraphQL 도 단점은 존재 합니다. 클라이언트와 서버 측에서 사용하기 위해서는 GraphQL 을 지원하는 도구가 필요합니다. 반면에 REST API 는 다른 사람의 API 를 사용하기 위해 특별한 라이브러리가 필요하지 않죠. REST 에서는 cURL 같은 일반적인 도구나 웹브라우저를 통해서 간단하게 요청을 해 볼 수 있습니다.\n\nGraphQL 은 캐시하기가 어려운 문제도 가지고 있습니다. REST 는 브라우저,CDN, 웹서버 등에서 활용되는 정의된 캐싱 동작이 있는데, HTTP 에서 제공하는 캐싱 전략을 그대로 사용할 수 없기에 GraphQL 만의 캐싱 전략으로 처리해야합니다. \n\n비교적 REST 에 비해서 제어할 수 있는 권한이 커진만큼 리스크도 있습니다. 필요한 데이터만을 요청할 수 있는 유연성이 제공되지만, 데이터 베이스에 영향을 줄 수 있습니다. 여러 테이블을 거치는 쿼리가 요청될 경우 예상치 못한 테이블 스캔이 발생될 수 있죠. 만약 전체 테이블 스캔을 하게 된다면 성능 저하로 이어질 수 있습니다.\n\n# GraphQL 의 특징\n\n## Mutation (데이터 수정)\n\nGraphQL 에서 데이터를 수정 하기 위해서는 Mutation 을 사용해야합니다.\n\n```graphql\nmutation AddNewUser($name: String!, $email: String!) {\n  addUser(name: $name, email: $email) {\n    id\n    name\n    email\n  }\n}\n```\n\n위 코드에서 `AddNewUser`는 해당 Mutation의 이름을 나타냅니다. `addUser`는 실제로 데이터를 수정하는GraphQL 서버의 리졸버 함수를 호출합니다. 이 함수는 `name`과 `email`을 인자로 받아 사용자를 추가하고, 추가된 사용자의 `id`, `name`, `email`을 반환합니다.\n\nMutation은 데이터베이스에 새로운 데이터를 추가하거나 기존 데이터를 업데이트하고자 할 때 사용됩니다. 이를 통해 클라이언트는 GraphQL 서버를 통해 데이터를 변경할 수 있습니다.\n\n## Subscription (실시간 데이터 알림)\n\nSubscription은 클라이언트가 실시간으로 데이터 변경 사항을 받을 수 있도록 하는 GraphQL의 기능입니다.\n\n```graphql\nsubscription NewPost {\n  postAdded {\n    id\n    title\n    content\n    author\n  }\n}\n```\n\n위 코드에서 `NewPost`는 해당 Subscription의 이름을 나타냅니다. `postAdded`는 서버 측에서 데이터 변경 사항을 감지하고, 변경된 데이터를 반환하는 GraphQL 서버의 리졸버 함수를 호출합니다. 클라이언트는 해당 Subscription을 구독(subscribe)하여 새로운 게시물이 추가될 때마다 `id`, `title`, `content`, `author`와 같은 필드를 받게 됩니다.\n\nSubscription은 실시간 채팅, 실시간 알림, 실시간 데이터 스트리밍 등 실시간 기능을 구현할 때 유용합니다. 클라이언트는 GraphQL 서버와 WebSocket 연결을 유지하여 서버에서 발생하는 데이터 변경 사항을 실시간으로 받을 수 있습니다.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-30T14:47:29.988040425Z","tags":["notes"]},"/notes/PowerShell-%EC%84%A4%EC%A0%95":{"title":"PowerShell 설정","content":"\n[[notes/🏃‍♂️ About Me|🏃‍♂️ About Me]]\n\n# PowerShell\n\n\n## Theme 꾸미기 \n- oh-my-posh\n- \n\n\n## 패키지 관리 프로그램 \n- Winget\n- Scoop\n- Choco\n\n\n## Powershell Readline\n\n\n\n## Alias 설정 하는 방법\n\n\n\n## Function 설정 하는 방법\n\n```powershell\nfunction name { set-location \"C:\\workspace\\folder\"}\n```\n\n\n\n## 사용하기 좋은 패키지\n\n-   7zip: 압축 및 아카이브 도구입니다.\n-   adb: 안드로이드 디버깅 브리지(ADB) 도구입니다.\n-   bat: 배치 파일을 실행하는 도구입니다.\n-   bottom: 터미널에서 사용할 수 있는 프로세스 모니터링 도구입니다.\n-   cacert: 인증서 패키지입니다. 2023년 1월 10일 버전입니다.\n-   cloc: 소스 코드 라인 수를 세는 도구입니다.\n-   curl: URL을 통해 데이터를 전송하는 도구입니다.\n-   dark: 다크 테마를 사용할 수 있는 프로그래밍 언어입니다.\n-   fzf: 명령어 라인에서 사용자 입력을 필터링 및 선택하는 도구입니다.\n-   go: Go 프로그래밍 언어의 컴파일러 및 빌드 도구입니다. 1.20.3 버전입니다.\n-   Graphviz: 그래프 시각화 도구입니다. 7.0.6 버전입니다.\n-   hugo: 정적 웹사이트 생성기입니다. 0.102.3 버전입니다.\n-   hugo-extended: 확장된 기능을 포함한 Hugo 정적 웹사이트 생성기입니다. 0.102.3 버전입니다.\n-   jq: JSON 데이터를 다루는 명령행 도구입니다. 1.6 버전입니다.\n-   ln: 심볼릭 링크를 생성하거나 파일을 링크하는 도구입니다. 0.2018.07.25 버전입니다.\n-   localsend: 로컬 네트워크를 통해 파일을 전송하는 도구입니다. 1.8.0 버전입니다.\n-   make: 소프트웨어 빌드 자동화 도구입니다. 4.3 버전입니다.\n-   neovim: 향상된 Vim 텍스트 편집기입니다. 0.6.1 버전입니다.\n-   ngrok: 로컬 포트를 공개적으로 접근 가능하게 해주는 도구입니다. 3.0.4 버전입니다.\n-   nmap: 네트워크 스캐닝 및 보안 감사 도구입니다. 7.93 버전입니다.\n-   oh-my-posh: PowerShell 테마 및 프롬프트 설정 도구입니다. 7.4.0 버전입니다.\n-   python: 파이썬 프로그래밍 언어입니다. 3.11.2 버전입니다.\n-   ruby: 루비 프로그래밍 언어입니다. 3.1.2-1 버전입니다.\n-   sass: CSS 전처리기로, 스타일 시트를 생성하는 도구입니다. 1.62.1 버전입니다.\n-   scrcpy: 안드로이드 디바이스를 컴퓨터에서 제어하고 화면을 표시하는 도구입니다. 1.23 버전입니다.\n-   sentry-cli: 애플리케이션 오류 및 예외를 모니터링하고 추적하는 도구입니다. 2.5.2 버전입니다.\n-   sudo: 다른 사용자 권한으로 명령어를 실행하는 도구입니다. 0.2020.01.26 버전입니다.\n-   telnet: 원격 호스트에 접속하기 위한 터미널 프로토콜 도구입니다. msys-inetutils-1.7-1 버전입니다.\n-   wget: 인터넷에서 파일을 다운로드하는 도구입니다. 1.21.3 버전입니다.\n-   which: 특정 명령어의 위치를 찾는 도구입니다. 2.20 버전입니다.","lastmodified":"2023-07-30T14:47:29.988040425Z","tags":["setup"]},"/private/quartz-guide/CJK-+-Latex-Support-%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95":{"title":"CJK + Latex Support (测试)","content":"\n## Chinese, Japanese, Korean Support\n几乎在我们意识到之前，我们已经离开了地面。\n\n우리가 그것을 알기도 전에 우리는 땅을 떠났습니다.\n\n私たちがそれを知るほぼ前に、私たちは地面を離れていました。\n\n## Latex\n\nBlock math works with two dollar signs `$$...$$`\n\n$$f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\n    f\\hat(\\xi),e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x}\n    \\,d\\xi$$\n\t\nInline math also works with single dollar signs `$...$`.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](content/private/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (测试)](content/private/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-30T14:47:29.988040425Z","tags":["setup"]},"/private/quartz-guide/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden. It comes with a really nice editor and graphical interface to preview all of your local files.\n\nThis step is **highly recommended**.\n\n\u003e 🔗 Step 3: [How to setup your Obsidian Vault to work with Quartz](content/private/obsidian.md)\n\n## Previewing Changes\nThis step is purely optional and mostly for those who want to see the published version of their digital garden locally before opening it up to the internet.

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](notes/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Create an Operand Account on [their website](https://operand.ai/).\n2. Go to Dashboard \u003e Settings \u003e Integrations.\n3. Follow the steps to setup the GitHub integration.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](content/private/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](content/private/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](content/private/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](content/private/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](content/private/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](content/private/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](content/private/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](content/private/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect!
