However, I've made most of the configuration completely optional so that the experience remains as close to vanilla if you choose to do so. Most of the in-application variables are recolored so that your custom snippets can be used easily with the theme.\nThis theme makes heavy use of the \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings\"\u003estyle settings\u003c/a\u003e plugin, which controls most of the features in the theme. The theme is perfectly usable even without style settings, but it's only a fraction of what it actually is with the plugin.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI will respond to feature/code removal only if there is substantial evidence of it being a direct copy of the original code and not just a simple imitation. (Please keep this point in mind before accusing me of being a low-effort theme developer.)\n\n### If you like my theme:\nI've made this theme primarily for my own purposes and it's completely free, but if you do like it enough to consider throwing a few coins in my hat, here's a link.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/anubisnekhet\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png\" alt=\"Buy Me A Coffee\" style=\"height: 60px !important;width: 217px !important;\" \u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\n## License\nAnuPpuccin is licensed under the GPL-3.0 license which allows you to modify the code freely, however the Copyright and license notices must be preserved in your CSS.

These are heavily integrated into the theme as they are directly used to stylize various UI elements.\n\n### Layouts\nAnuppuccin currently supports 2 layout variants.\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"assets/gh-layout-preview.webp\"\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\n### Rainbow folders\nThe theme comes with a toggleable rainbow folder snippet which color-codes your folders as per their order in the filesystem.\u003cbr\u003e\nIt's great if you need to easily distinguish between folders or if you want to make your vault look a bit prettier (Both in my case :P)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"assets/gh-rainbow-preview.webp\"\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\n#### Full rainbow theme\nThis snippet makes the rainbow theme apply to the first layer of the root directory, aka only direct children.\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can choose if it applies to root files as well and customise the indentation border color.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n#### Simple rainbow theme\nThis snippet makes the rainbow theme apply to every folder in your filesystem, and the order is determined by the children's place in the parent folder.\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can toggle if the recolor applies to the title, the collapse border, the collapse icon and you can append a small icon to the folder title as well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Alternate tabs\n\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"assets/gh-preview-tabs.webp\"\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\n### Customisable Decorations\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"assets/gh-decorations-preview.webp\"\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\nBold and italic colors can be toggled on and off and can be customised according to the palette as well.\n\n### Custom Backgrounds\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"assets/bg-image-preview.webp\"\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\n### Callouts\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"assets/gh-callout-preview.webp\"\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\nThe theme comes with many custom callout styles (which can be toggled so they won't interfere with your own callout snippet).\u003cbr\u003e\nThe snippet also includes support for using the colors of your selected palette which means that the callouts don't ever look out of place :)\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you use the admonition plugin/have custom callout colors, they won't be affected by the recolor as it only targets vanilla callouts. However, you can make them use AnuPpuccin's palette to support dynamic per-palette theming.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Custom checkboxes \u0026 Speech bubbles\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"assets/gh-checkbox-preview.webp\" width=\"50%\"\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\nAnuppuccin's custom checkboxes try to mimic the original checkbox design as much as possible, while still being optional incase you want to use your own checkbox snippet.\nSpeech bubbles have been provided which are useful for language learners and RPG vault users alike.\u003cbr\u003eCustom checkboxes have been designed to match those provided by the \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/ceciliamay/obsidianmd-theme-primary\"\u003ePrimary\u003c/a\u003e theme for ease of migration and consistency.\n\n| Syntax | Description

color on the top-most bar.\n\n### Simplified markdown embeds\nMarkdown embeds have an alternate styling with an animated variant which can be toggled globally using style settings or individually using alt names for embeds, for example: `![[embed|alt-name]]`\n\n| Embed style | Alt name |\n| ----------- | -------- |\n| Seamless | seamless |\n\n## Colorschemes used\n**Note**: Colorschemes that aren't in the base theme can be used through the [extended colorschemes](https://github.com/AnubisNekhet/AnuPpuccin/blob/main/snippets/extended-colorschemes.css) snippet. \u003cbr\u003e **Important**: Some colorschemes have been been modified to fit the Catppuccin color value style, which means there will be some changes made to make the theme feel more natural.\n\n| Theme | Light Mode | Dark Mode

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](content/private/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (测试)](content/private/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-28T15:02:02.850225966Z","tags":["setup"]},"/private/quartz-guide/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files.

You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site.

Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

Then,\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\ncd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Start local server\nmake serve\n\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\n```\n\n\u003e 🌍 Step 5: [Hosting Quartz online!](content/private/hosting.md)","lastmodified":"2023-05-28T15:02:02.850225966Z","tags":["setup"]},"/private/quartz-guide/private-note":{"title":"Private Stuff","content":"\nThis page doesn't get published!","lastmodified":"2023-05-28T15:02:02.850225966Z","tags":[]},"/private/quartz-guide/search":{"title":"Search","content":"\nQuartz supports two modes of searching through content.\n\n## Full-text\nFull-text search is the default in Quartz. It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Create an Operand Account on [their website](https://operand.ai/).\n2. Go to Dashboard \u003e Settings \u003e Integrations.\n3. Follow the steps to setup the GitHub integration. Operand needs access to GitHub in order to index your digital garden properly!\n4. Head over to Dashboard \u003e Objects and press `(Cmd + K)` to open the omnibar and select 'Create Collection'.\n\t1. Set the 'Collection Label' to something that will help you remember it.\n\t2. You can leave the 'Parent Collection' field empty.\n5. Click into your newly made Collection.\n\t1. Press the 'share' button that looks like three dots connected by lines.\n\t2. Set the 'Interface Type' to `object-search` and click 'Create'.\n\t3. This will bring you to a new page with a search bar. Ignore this for now.\n6. Go back to Dashboard \u003e Settings \u003e API Keys and find your Quartz-specific Operand API key under 'Other keys'.\n\t1. Copy the key (which looks something like `0e733a7f-9b9c-48c6-9691-b54fa1c8b910`).\n\t2. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true` and `operandApiKey` to your copied key.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: true\noperandApiKey: \"0e733a7f-9b9c-48c6-9691-b54fa1c8b910\"\n```\n7. Make a commit and push your changes to GitHub. See the [[content/private/hosting|hosting]] page if you haven't done this already.\n\t1. This step is *required* for Operand to be able to properly index your content. \n\t2. Head over to Dashboard \u003e Objects and select the collection that you made earlier\n8. Press `(Cmd + K)` to open the omnibar again and select 'Create GitHub Repo'\n\t1. Set the 'Repository Label' to `Quartz`\n\t2. Set the 'Repository Owner' to your GitHub username\n\t3. Set the 'Repository Ref' to `master`\n\t4. Set the 'Repository Name' to the name of your repository (usually just `quartz` if you forked the repository without changing the name)\n\t5. Leave 'Root Path' and 'Root URL' empty\n9. Wait for your repository to index and enjoy natural language search in Quartz! Operand refreshes the index every 2h so all you need to do is just push to GitHub to update the contents in the search.","lastmodified":"2023-05-28T15:02:02.850225966Z","tags":[]},"/private/quartz-guide/setup":{"title":"Setup","content":"\n## Making your own Quartz\nSetting up Quartz requires a basic understanding of `git`. If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\n📁 [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat! Now you have everything you need to start editing and growing your digital garden.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](content/private/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](content/private/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](content/private/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](content/private/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](content/private/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](content/private/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](content/private/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](content/private/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n🐛 [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)","lastmodified":"2023-05-28T15:02:02.850225966Z","tags":[]},"/private/quartz-guide/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
